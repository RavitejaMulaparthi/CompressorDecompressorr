# CompressorDecompressorr

Introducing a new minor project in Java: a compressor and decompressor application. The primary objective of this project is to employ compression techniques to reduce the required number of bits for data representation. It strictly focuses on lossless conversion methods to ensure data integrity throughout the compression process. By implementing this project, users can benefit from various advantages of compression, including efficient storage utilization, accelerated file transfers, and decreased storage hardware and network bandwidth expenses. The emphasis on lossless compression techniques guarantees that no data is lost during the compression process, safeguarding the integrity of the compressed data.
